## TANF Slider Map

Yearly TANF Coverage from 2015 to 2021.
Website by Sophia Fox-Dichter for Command Line GIS Final Project

For this assignment, I calculated how many families in poverty were receiving TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, sometimes called welfare) coverage by state for each year from 2015 until 2021. I used data gathered from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates to capture the number of families in poverty and data from the Office of Family Assistance for TANF caseload. These data are current as of January 2024 and were prepared by their respective agencies. I added them to state shapefiles to create a geodataframe that was mapable. There were no issues with data quality to address. 

The following maps show 2015 and 20221 data.

The next map is interactive. It provides a chloropleth layer for each year from 2015 to 2021 and clickable information for 2021 by state.
